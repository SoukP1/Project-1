# Project 1 Portfolio Simulator

**Welcome to our Portfolio Simulator. This was created to be able to predict the theoretical performance
of a portfolio of stocks using historical close price data and a Monte Carlo simluation.**

The simulator uses a Streamlit dashboard. A user can upload a csv file that contains the symbols of stocks they wish to pick
as well as the quantity. From their, the user will choose the start and end date range that they would like. From there, the 
user will pick how long they wish to hold their stocks. After all the parameters are set, the simulator can be started to see 
how their portoflio will perform based on the historical close price data from the date range chosen and length of time to hold
the stocks.

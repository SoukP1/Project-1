## Project-1 Monte Carlo Simulation

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://streamlit.io/) 

### Project description 
Using the streamlit app to help us show a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.Monte Carlo simulation performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values—a probability distribution—for any factor that has inherent uncertainty. It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions.
